description: ReadsProfiler is an application that uses multithreading for processing a number of clients. It will create a profile for every user and they will be able to add to their personal library in different shelves ("Reading", "Read", "Dropped", "Planning to read") and other info (ex. a review). After more reviews, each user will have a profile on which they will get recommended books based on what they have already read. Also, the user can search for a book (name or ISBN), author, genre or, as an admin, they can add books, authors, and any other info through an intuitive console.<br><a href="https://github.com/raresmac/ReadsProfiler">Github Repo</a>
